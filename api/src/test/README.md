# Tests for `api/`

I've written tests for the only `RestFunctions` class and its static methods. 
Liam told me not to worry about testing the routers.

**NOTE: These tests will not run with Java 8.**

To actually try them out, I upgraded to Java 11/12 by modifying my project
structure in IntelliJ to use the correct JDK.
